# AI Trend-to-Design Challenge

This project implements an end-to-end AI-powered fashion design pipeline that detects trends from product images and generates new fashion designs.

## Objective

To recognize fashion trends from product datasets and automatically create new designs using generative AI.

## Workflow

Data Preparation – Downloaded a fashion dataset with product images & metadata.

Trend Detection – Extracted embeddings, applied clustering to group similar looks.

Prompt Generation – Created short descriptive prompts for each cluster.

Design Generation – Generated new designs using a generative model.

Evaluation & Feedback – Scored outputs with yes/no feedback and refined weaker designs.

Final Output – Delivered a polished design per trend cluster with prompts, scores, and process logs.

## Tech Stack

Python (data handling & workflow automation)

Image Embeddings & Clustering (trend detection)

Generative AI Models (design creation)

Feedback Loop (iterative refinement)

## Project Structure

Trend-to-design-AI.ipynb → Main notebook with full pipeline

Outputs → Generated fashion designs & logs

## Results

Meaningful fashion clusters extracted from product images.

AI-generated designs aligned with trend clusters.

Feedback-based iterative refinement improved design quality.
